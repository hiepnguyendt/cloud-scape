The workshop application makes use of the [top navigation pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/general/service-navigation/top-navigation/)  and the [layout pattern](https://cloudscape.design/foundation/visual-foundation/layout/)  to lay out a few of the essential components on a page. In this first assignment, you'll start with a minimally bootstrapped application and finish with your first page using Cloudscape components.

Before getting started, it is always useful to familiarize yourself with the component API and design documentation. In this step, we'll look at the following components to build a basic layout:
1. [Top navigation](2-1-top-nav-component/) component to render the application's header.
2. [App layout](2-2-app-layout-component/) component to render the provided content.
3. [Side navigation](2-3-side-nav-to-app-layout/)  component to render the navigation menu.
4. [Breadcrumb group](2-4-breadcrumb-to-app-layout/) component which reflects the information architecture of our application.
5. [Content to the app layout](2-5-content-to-app-layout/) component provides the basic layout for the header and content of a page
6. [Component for dashboard](2-6-explore-component-dashboard/) added predefined content for the dashboard page
7. [Explore the top navigation component](2-7-explore-top-nav-component/)

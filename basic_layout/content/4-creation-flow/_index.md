While viewing resources is important, in a real use case there would not be any resources to view, unless we let users create them. In this step, we'll look at the [create resource pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/resource-management/create/single-page-create/)  and then further enhance this code with the [form field validation pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/general/validation/)  to add new flavors for our chocolate factory.

Hands off from coding. In this step, we'll apply the [create resource pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/resource-management/create/single-page-create/)  and then further enhance this code with the [form field validation pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/general/validation/).

Take 5-10 minutes to familiarize yourself with the two patterns we're working with.

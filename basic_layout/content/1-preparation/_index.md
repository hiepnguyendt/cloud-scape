In this workshop, we will use the open source Cloudscape Design System to build a responsive and accessible web application for cloud management. The web application will leverage the open source React components offered by Cloudscape. The workshop requires knowledge of front-end development, React and TypeScript.

You'll start this workshop with an empty React TypeScript project and finish by building a basic application using Cloudscape components. Along the way, you'll be introduced to a few of our core patterns and corresponding components necessary to implement these patterns.

If you have any issues during the workshop, please reach out to us directly. We'll do our best to help.

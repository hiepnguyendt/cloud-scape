Congratulations! Youâ€™ve created a chocolate factory application game that applies multiple Cloudscape patterns and components.

Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp of how Cloudscape works.

If you have extra time or want to practice your new Cloudscape skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the Chocolate Factory application:

- Set up and add unit tests to your application by following the [testing guidance](https://cloudscape.design/get-started/testing/introduction/).
- Set up and add integration tests to your application by following the [testing guidance](https://cloudscape.design/get-started/testing/introduction/).
- [Communicate to users that unsaved changes on the form page will be discarded when users leave a page](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/general/unsaved-changes/).
- Help users to easily and quickly access help within the interface and current workflow on the form page by applying the [help system pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/resource-management/details/).
- Create a detail view when selecting a Flavor in the Table view by applying the [resource details pattern](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/resource-management/details/).
- To get more inspiration on what can be done, check out the [Cloudscape demo pages](https://cloudscape.design/demos/overview/)  and explore the source code.

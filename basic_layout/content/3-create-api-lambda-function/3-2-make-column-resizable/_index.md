Let's make the columns resizable. With column resizing, the user can manually resize the column width by dragging the divider on the right of a column header.

Users can also reveal, hide, and adjust the content to the screen area. To do that, add the ``resizableColumns={true}`` property to the <Table /> component;

Try out resizing the columns in your browser!

This step did not contain any visual changes reflected on the page - the table columns are now interactive.

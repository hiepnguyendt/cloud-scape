### Build a cloud experience with Cloudscape Design System ðŸš€
In this workshop, we will use the open source Cloudscape Design System  to build a responsive and accessible web application for cloud management. The web application will leverage the open source React components offered by Cloudscape.

We'll go from an empty React TypeScript project to building a basic application using Cloudscape components. You'll be introduced to a few of our core patterns, along with the corresponding components necessary to implement these patterns. Every step in this workshop can be started independently by checking out the associated branch.

### Learning Objectives
The main learning objective of this workshop is to introduce you to Cloudscape through building a web application.

This workshop is divided into three steps:

In the first step, you will learn how to create the basic structure for the webapp. It contains the top navigation and the application layout which will be used throughout the workshop.
The second step is all about viewing resources. You will implement a table and enrich its functionality step by step.
Finally, in the third step, you will learn about creating resources and validation. You will see how form handling works with Cloudscape by using multiple patterns.
Here's a preview showing the workshop application we're building:

Step 1: Basic layout	Step 2: Table view	Step 3: Creation flow

### About Cloudscape Design System
Cloudscape  is an open source design system to create web applications. It was built for and is used by Amazon Web Services (AWS) products and services. We created it in 2016 to improve the user experience across web applications owned by AWS services, and also to help teams implement those applications faster. Since then, we have continued enhancing the system based on customer feedback and research.

### Estimated Run Time
This workshop takes about 1.5 hours to complete.

### Audience
This workshop requires knowledge of frontend development. As such, you should be familiar with: React, TypeScript, Git, the JavaScript programming language, and typing commands in the Terminal.
